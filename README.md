## Description
```
In this project you will be working with a cryptographic library, doing various 
tasks with the goal of becoming more comfortable with using a cryptographic library.
```

## Tasks
```
1. Your first task is to select an environment and a cryptographic library. This 
library needs support for at least AES, RSA and SHA-256 (which will be used in later 
projects). Once you have selected a library, make a test to make sure you can compile 
some code and do some rudimentary task with it. Keep in mind that depending on the 
environment, you might not have one installed natively in your environment. In that case 
you will need to install that library.

2. Start by generating several files of different lengths (one of them very short, shorter 
than 128 bits), another at least 1Mbyte. These can be generated by programs or manually created. 
Then, write a program to encrypt them using AES, with 128 and 256 bit keys. This key should be 
generated randomly, using a cryptographically secure random number generator.  Determine how many 
times you can encrypt and decrypt a particular file in a second. Make a calculation to determine 
what size of file you could decrypt in one second with various settings.
